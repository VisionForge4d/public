# ðŸ“‚ public/

Welcome to the public layer of the VisionForge4D system.

This repository houses polished tools, prompts, and systems that are clean enough to share, clone, or build upon. Everything here has been through the forge â€” refined, tested, and structured for real-world use.

---

## âœ… What You'll Find

- **AI workflows** designed for creative, legal, or operational use
- **Reusable GPT prompt packs** with clear utility
- **System design kits** that blend cognition, aesthetics, and automation
- **Minimal-dependency builds** you can spin up fast

Each module or sub-repo follows these standards:

- A `README.md` explaining purpose and usage
- Clear folder structure â€” no temp files or half-finished drafts
- Version tags or changelogs where appropriate

---

## ðŸ§­ Sample Modules (or Whatâ€™s Coming Soon)

- `prompt-pack-v1/`: Reusable GPT templates
- `ritual-audit-kit/`: Markdown + PDF version of the Ritualware diagnostic
- `visionforge-tier1/`: Personal operating system starter pack

## ðŸ›¡ License & Use

Each tool or folder contains its own license (MIT, CC-BY, etc). Unless stated otherwise:

> Youâ€™re welcome to clone, study, and build on these â€” attribution is appreciated. For commercial use or deeper collaboration, [reach out](VisionForge@gmail.com).

---

## ðŸ§± Curation Criteria

Only tools that are:
- Functional and documented
- Easy to set up
- Mature enough to deploy or teach from

...are promoted to this layer. This repo isnâ€™t a lab â€” itâ€™s a launchpad.

VisionForge4D is about building systems that **serve people** â€” creative, technical, intentional. This public folder is one piece of that vision.
