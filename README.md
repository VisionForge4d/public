# ðŸ“‚ public/

This folder contains **polished tools, prompts, and systems** that are clean enough to share, clone, or deploy. These builds are functional, documented, and version-controlled.

## âœ… What Goes Here

- AI tools, scripts, or prompts that are reusable
- Design systems or workflows that have matured past experimentation
- Readme-rich mini repos youâ€™d feel confident linking in a portfolio, Gumroad, or GitHub showcase

## ðŸ§± Structure Guidelines

Each project should include:

- `README.md` â€” clear what it does + how to use it
- Clean folder layout (no temp files, unfinished drafts)
- Version tags or changelogs (if needed)
- Minimal dependencies or a clear install/setup script

## ðŸ§­ Examples (Planned or Future)

- `prompt-pack-v1/`: Reusable GPT templates
- `ritual-audit-kit/`: PDF + markdown version of the Ritualware diagnostic
- `visionforge-tier1/`: Shareable system seeds for personal operating models

## ðŸš¦ Promotion Criteria

Only promote to `public/` when:
- It has a README
- It runs, renders, or ships without manual babysitting
- You wouldnâ€™t be embarrassed if a stranger cloned it and used it

If in doubt, leave it in `lab/` until itâ€™s solid.
