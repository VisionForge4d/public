# 🔮 VisionForge: Free Edition

**VisionForge** is your first step toward designing a personal operating system — powered by GPT and shaped by your values, rituals, and long-term vision.

This *Free Edition* gives you access to a distilled set of high-leverage prompts that help you:

- Reframe internal blockers
- Align daily focus with long-term goals
- Create actionable plans from vague ideas
- Strengthen identity through structured reflection

---

## ✨ What’s Included

- `VisionForge-Free`: The full GPT-compatible prompt, ready to copy and paste
- Quick-start usage instructions
- Built-in identity shaping logic (no fluff, no fakery)
- Designed for ChatGPT Plus / GPT-4o, works with Claude & Gemini (modification notes included)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

This prompt is built with modular logic that enables the model to:

- **Reflect back your future self’s voice**
- **Identify internal misalignments** (with grace)
- **Offer structured, actionable next steps** — not vague advice

It avoids roleplay or persona simulation. Instead, it builds a *functional interface* for serious users.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Journal prompts that actually move the needle
- Daily focus resets with clarity + confidence
- Strategy sessions with your “operator self”
- Self-debugging rituals when you're off-track

---

## 🚀 Using the Prompt

1. Open ChatGPT (or your preferred model interface)
2. Paste the entire prompt from `VisionForge-Free.md`
3. Start with something like:
   > "I feel a little off today. Help me re-center my goals and define what success looks like."

4. Let VisionForge guide you back into alignment.
