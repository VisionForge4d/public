# 🗓️ First Week: Builder Onboarding Tracker

> *“Momentum isn’t magic — it’s ritual.”*

Use this file as your self-guided entry into the Schoolhouse vault system.  
You’re not here to learn everything.  
You’re here to start **building, tagging, and saving** what matters.

---

## ✅ Day 1: Set Up the Forge

- [ ] Install Obsidian + create `schoolhouse-vault`
- [ ] Add folder structure:
  - `/modules`
  - `/rituals`
  - `/outputs`
  - `/templates`
- [ ] Open `schoolhouse-onboarding.md`
- [ ] Write your first file in `/outputs/` → `obsidian-practice-note.md`

---

## ✅ Day 2: Prompt Fluency

- [ ] Read `prompt-writing-basics.md`
- [ ] Copy-paste a basic prompt → test it in GPT
- [ ] Save the final version as `outputs/first-build-[name].md`

---

## ✅ Day 3: Vault Motion

- [ ] Use `[[linking]]` to connect two notes
- [ ] Add 2+ tags to a file (`#ritual`, `#builder-tools`, etc.)
- [ ] Preview/Toggle edit mode (Ctrl+E)

---

## ✅ Day 4: Run a Ritual

- [ ] Open `ritual-reset.md` when stuck or distracted
- [ ] Use the 3-question prompt
- [ ] Journal the insight in a new note inside `/outputs/`

---

## ✅ Day 5: Template Usage

- [ ] Open `debugger-template.md` or `output-log-template.md`
- [ ] Use one with a live prompt or real friction issue
- [ ] Modify and save a new version as your own

---

## ✅ Day 6: Stack + Remix

- [ ] Read `modular-stack-example.md`
- [ ] Build your own 3-block modular prompt
- [ ] Test it in GPT, then archive it in `outputs/`

---

## ✅ Day 7: Reflect + Integrate

- [ ] Open `system-map.md` and add links to your key files
- [ ] Tag one prompt `#first-build` and mark it “ready”
- [ ] Ask GPT to suggest 3 next modules based on your progress

Mark progress, don’t chase perfection.  
The Schoolhouse isn’t school — it’s a scaffolding.
