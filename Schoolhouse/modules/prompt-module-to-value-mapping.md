# 🎓 Schoolhouse Module: Mapping Prompt Modules to Value

> “Every prompt module is a product fragment — the value is already inside it.”

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Learn how to extract, classify, and monetize reusable prompt blocks.  
By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:
- Identify high-leverage prompt structures
- Map them to digital product paths (GPTs, PDFs, vaults)
- Position them inside a revenue-generating system

## 🧱 Learning Blocks

### 🧠 1. *What Makes a Prompt Valuable?*

A prompt has value when it:
- Solves a real problem (clarity, friction, time, emotion, money)
- Creates leverage (automation, reuse, insight)
- Can be:
  - Reused by others
  - Taught as a framework
  - Embedded in higher systems (PDF, GPT, dashboard)

✅ *Example:*  
A ritual-cue prompt used in AI journaling that can also be licensed for coaches or therapists.

---

### 🔍 2. *Identify Module Types*

Use `prompt-inventory.md` and apply value-focused tags:

- `ritual` → daily driver  
- `diagnostic` → identifies pain/friction  
- `refactor` → transforms existing input  
- `builder` → helps generate assets  
- `insight` → delivers clarity/intuition  
- `exporter` → formats for reuse/sharing  
- `loop` → reinforces usage behavior  
- `mirror` → reflects identity back to user  
- `monetizer` → directly tied to income outcomes

✅ *Example:*  
“The Debugger” = `diagnostic` + `loop` + `mirror`

---

### 💰 3. *Map to Value Paths*

Choose 1–2 viable product routes:

- **A) PDF or digital download**  
  - Prompt → walkthrough → reuse license

- **B) GPT micro-tool**  
  - Modular prompt wrapped in a custom GPT instance (sell as micro-agent)

- **C) Notion/Obsidian Vault module**  
  - Prompt layered into ritual dashboards or daily workflows

- **D) Premium System Component**  
  - Included in high-ticket offer (coaching, agency, premium vault)

✅ *Sketch:*  
Where does this module fit inside a **Value Ladder**?  
What comes before/after it in a user journey?

## ✏️ Practice Prompt (Tutor Mode)

```prompt
Act as a monetization strategist for AI prompt-based tools.  
I’ll give you a prompt module.  
You’ll analyze its utility, suggest 2–3 packaging paths,  
and give a real-world monetization angle.
