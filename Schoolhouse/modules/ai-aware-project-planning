# 🎓 Schoolhouse Module — AI-Aware Project Planning

> “You don’t ask AI to build the tower. You ask it to help lay the bricks — one strategic block at a time.”

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By the end of this module, students will:
- Learn how to plan projects with LLM behavior, token limits, and prompt memory in mind  
- Gain tactics for building modular prompt stacks before writing any code  
- Be able to architect multi-phase projects that stack value while reducing model confusion

## 🧱 Learning Blocks

---

### 🧠 1. Planning for Token Drift & Model Forgetting

**Definition:**  
LLMs operate within *bounded attention*. Token limits create **cognitive amnesia** over long sessions or complex instructions. Planning must respect these constraints, not fight them.

**Core Ideas:**
- Every model has a short-term memory cap (4k, 8k, 32k, etc.) — beyond that, coherence drops.
- Repetitive context = wasted tokens. Structure reusables early.
- The more recent, relevant, and clean your prompt is → the sharper the output.

**Common Triggers / Use Cases:**  
- Long threads with bloated memory  
- Confused responses after multiple follow-ups  
- Unexpected “drift” in tone, detail, or logic

---

### 🔍 2. Prompt Stack Design Before Execution

**Principle:**  
*Design your prompt infrastructure before deploying your build cycle.* Treat prompts as tools in a tactical loadout.

| Layer | Purpose | Example Prompt |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 🔧 Tool Layer | Utility actions | “Generate a file/folder structure for X”  
| 🧠 Mindset Layer | Identity + framing | “Act as a product architect. I need…”  
| 🔁 Feedback Layer | QA + iteration | “Review this plan for gaps in logic or assumptions.”  
| 🧱 Structural Layer | Assembly logic | “Split this project into 4 milestone-based arcs.”  

**Prompt Engineering Insight:**  
A great output depends more on *sequencing and role framing* than pure length or clever words.

### 🛠️ 3. Practical Application / Ritual UX

#### 📅 Scheduling Prompts (Don’t Do It All At Once)

Instead of:
> “Build me the full stack web app with auth, DB, payment, and docs…”

Break it into **time-boxed sessions**:

1. 🧭 **Planning Session**
   ```prompt
   Act as a technical product planner.  
   Given a goal to build [X], map the build into 3–5 milestone phases.  
   Identify dependencies, blockers, and token-aware chunking.

2.🧰 Scaffold Session

For Phase 1 (from above), generate a file/folder structure with rationale.  
Don’t generate any code — just the layout and notes.

3. 🧱 Component Builder

Pick a single component from Phase 1 and generate clean, commented code.  
Assume no memory of prior outputs. Include the dependencies up top.

4.🧽 Refactor Session

Review this component for structure, best practices, and testability.  
Suggest improvements or refactor options with clarity.


⚙️ UX Deployment Tips
Treat prompts like API endpoints — they do one thing well.

Always keep prompt stacks reusable. Store them.

Use versioning logic: prompt.plan.v1, prompt.refactor.v2, etc.

When in doubt: Prompt → Plan → Execute → QA → Repeat

✏️ Practice Prompt (Tutor Mode)

Act as a strategic AI system planner.  
Given a goal to launch a modular contract generation tool,  
break the work into 3–5 phases, considering AI prompt design, token limits,  
user interaction flow, and component architecture.  
Highlight where prompts should be reused, what each phase outputs,  
and how to avoid overloading the model or losing coherence.
