# 🧭 Obsidian Catch-Up Module  
> *“You’re not late. You’re entering with context.”*

This is your jumpstart into how we use Obsidian inside the **Schoolhouse method** and broader AI-builder ecosystem. This isn’t a note-taking system — it’s an **infrastructure tool** for memory, modularity, and prompt-based productivity.

## 🧠 What You’re Building

| Asset | Function |
|-------|----------|
| `schoolhouse-vault/` | Root directory for all prompt learning + builder tools |
| `/modules/` | Saved lessons + prompt packs |
| `/rituals/` | Reusable behavior scaffolds (daily ops, friction resets, etc) |
| `/outputs/` | Saved prompts you generate + test |
| `/templates/` | Fill-in frameworks for new prompt types |
| `/system-map.md` | Index + high-level structure |

## 📦 Obsidian Setup (Fast Start)

1. **Install Obsidian** → [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
2. Create a new vault:  
   `schoolhouse-vault`
3. Create these folders:
/modules  
/rituals  
/outputs  
/templates



## 🔁 How This Vault Works

- Everything in here is built for **copy-paste fluency**
- Prompts are written in Markdown (`.md`) for clarity + AI compatibility
- You’ll reuse, remix, and relabel prompts as **tools**, not throwaways
- Each file should include:
- A clear title
- Tags (`#diagnostic`, `#ritual`, etc.)
- Notes on output quality and tweak history

## 🛠 Key Files to Start With

- `prompt-writing-basics.md`  
- `modular-prompting-intro.md`  
- `schoolhouse-method.md`  
- `ai-usage-guide.md` (Non-Plus versioning tips)
- `output-log-template.md`  
- `prompt-type-tags.md` (e.g., `mirror`, `refactor`, `exporter`)

These will be dropped into your `/modules/` folder as you onboard.

## 📣 When Lost…

Ask one of these questions in a new `.md` file and use ChatGPT:
```prompt
What type of prompt am I building?
What are the reusable blocks here?
How would I store this for next time?
