# 🎓 Schoolhouse Module — Blender Intro for Builders

> “You don’t need to master Blender. You need to master momentum in Blender.”

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By the end of this module, students will:
- Understand Blender as a modular creative tool — not a monolith  
- Learn the core layout, tool sets, and save workflow  
- Be able to model simple objects, set a camera, and export a scene

## 🧱 Learning Blocks

---

### 🧠 1. Blender Isn’t Hard — It’s Deep

**Definition:**  
Blender is a free, open-source 3D creation suite. It handles **modeling, sculpting, animation, lighting, texturing, rendering**, and more — but you only need a few of these to get going.

**Beginner Success Principle:**  
> You only need to master 3–5 tools to tell a story.

**Common Use Cases:**  
- Modeling boats, buildings, or props  
- Setting emotional tone with light and camera  
- Creating stylized scenes for indie storytelling  
- Simulating natural environments (water, fog, grass)

### 🔍 2. Core Vocabulary

| Term | What It Means | What It’s For |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `Object Mode` | Move, scale, rotate whole objects | Placing items in the scene  
| `Edit Mode` | Modify vertices/edges/faces | Modeling shapes  
| `Modifier` | Procedural changes (non-destructive) | Subsurf, mirror, bevel  
| `Material` | Surface properties (color, roughness) | Making things look real/fake  
| `Shader` | Under-the-hood material logic | Used with `Shader Editor`  
| `Camera` | Point of view for the render | Where your “viewer” sits  
| `Light` | Scene illumination | Key to mood and visibility  
| `Render` | Final output image/animation | What you export/share

### 🛠️ 3. Practical Application / Ritual UX

#### 🚀 Your First Blender Ritual

1. **Open Blender → General Scene**
2. `Shift + A` → Add a Mesh → Cube/Sphere/etc.  
3. `Tab` → Edit Mode → Select face/edge/vertex → Move (`G`), Scale (`S`), Rotate (`R`)  
4. `Ctrl + A` → Apply scale after edits  
5. Add a **Camera** → Align it with view → `Ctrl + Alt + Numpad 0`  
6. Add **Lighting** → Point light or HDRI  
7. Set Material → Base Color, Roughness  
8. `F12` → Render Image  
9. `Image → Save As...` → Export final frame

---

#### ♻️ Reusable Asset Tips

- Save objects as **.blend files** with named collections  
- Use **linked assets** for reusable props (boats, tools, foliage)  
- Use **Asset Browser** for drag-and-drop workflows  
- Label materials and modifiers cleanly for future use

---

### 🎨 Bonus: Expressive Touches for Scene Mood

| Element | Tip |
|--------|-----|
| **Camera Movement** | Use slow dolly/pan → Emotional gravity  
| **Lighting** | Soft area lights for atmosphere → Use color temperature  
| **Materials** | Low gloss = soft, poetic feel  
| **Fog/Mist** | Use volumetric shaders or world nodes  
| **Motion** | Slow animations > fast action for indie tone

## ✏️ Practice Prompt (Tutor Mode)

```prompt
Act as a Blender coach.  
Help the user create a simple fjord scene with one boat model, fog, and soft lighting.  
Give step-by-step guidance on building the terrain, placing the camera,  
and using modifiers or materials to evoke quiet mood.  
Assume the user knows the basics but not the terminology for visual poetry.

🧠 Reminder for Indie Builders
You are not building Marvel movies.
You’re capturing moments. Emotion. Light. Stillness.

Let the Blender stack serve your story — not the other way around.
