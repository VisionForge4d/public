# 🖥️ Obsidian Interface Primer  
> *“Treat the interface like a forge, not a folder.”*

This module teaches you **how to move inside Obsidian** like a builder — focused on clarity, speed, and modular thinking. You’ll learn how to navigate, create, and command your vault like a true operator.

## 🎯 Why Obsidian?

Obsidian is:
- Local-first → no internet required
- Markdown-native → great for GPT, vaults, and exports
- Plugin-rich → powerful once you grow

We’re using it as our **thinking engine**, not a to-do list.
