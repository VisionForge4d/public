# 📘 Prompt Writing Basics

> *“Clarity beats cleverness. Every time.”*

This module teaches you how to structure effective prompts that are reusable, modular, and GPT-friendly.  
You don’t need to be clever. You need to be **clear**.

## 🧠 What Is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is a structured input you give an AI to guide its response.  
Good prompts create **predictable**, **adaptable**, and **reusable** results.

You're not writing messages.  
You're designing tools.

## 🧱 Anatomy of a Prompt

| Block         | Function                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Role`        | Who the AI should act as                 |
| `Instruction` | What task the AI is supposed to perform  |
| `Tone`        | How the answer should feel               |
| `Format`      | How the answer should be returned        |

Think in blocks. Each part can be reused across different prompts.
