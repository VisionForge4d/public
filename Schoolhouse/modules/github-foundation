# 🎓 Schoolhouse Module — GitHub Fundamentals & Culture

> “GitHub isn’t just a code platform — it’s where builders show their work, shape the future, and share the forge.”

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

By the end of this module, students will:
- Understand GitHub as a **version control and collaboration system**  
- Learn the key terminology, habits, and etiquette of GitHub use  
- Grasp the values behind open-source development and its impact on the dev world

---

## 🧱 Learning Blocks

---

### 🧠 1. What Is GitHub, Really?

**Definition:**  
GitHub is a platform for version-controlled project development. But more than that, it's the **global infrastructure for digital builders** — a public ledger of work, reputation, and shared progress.

**Core Functions:**
- Store and track code changes over time
- Collaborate with others using forks, branches, pull requests
- Showcase your work, build community, or work in private

**GitHub =** Resume + Workspace + OS for the modern builder.

### 📘 2. GitHub Glossary for New Builders

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `Repo` | A project folder on GitHub | `visionforge4d/ritualware`  
| `Commit` | A snapshot of changes | “Added authentication logic”  
| `Branch` | A separate line of development | `feature/login-ui`  
| `Pull Request (PR)` | A proposed change to merge into main | “Please review and merge this feature”  
| `Issue` | A task, bug, or idea | “Bug: Page not loading on mobile”  
| `Fork` | A copy of a repo you can edit freely | Fork a tool to customize for your stack  
| `Clone` | Download the repo locally | `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`  
| `Merge` | Combine changes into main code | “Merged the PR after review”  
| `README` | Intro doc in a repo | First thing people see — your mission, how to use  
| `Main` | The main branch (used to be `master`) | Where your production-ready code lives

### 🌍 3. The Culture of Open Source

**Open Source Isn’t Charity — It’s Leverage.**

**Core Values:**
- 💡 Transparency: Anyone can inspect, learn, and improve  
- 🧠 Collaboration: The best code grows through dialogue  
- 🧱 Modularity: Reuse what works, improve what doesn’t  
- 🎖️ Reputation: Your commits are public proof of skill  
- 🕸️ Network: Every star, fork, or PR builds real-world connection

**“Source code is the new portfolio.”**

### 🛠️ 4. Practical Application / Ritual UX

#### 🧰 Daily Developer Ritual (Beginner to Intermediate)

- 🛫 `git pull` before you start — sync with the latest changes  
- 🔨 Make progress → `git add .`, `git commit -m "what you did"`  
- 🚀 Push it up: `git push`  
- 🧠 Log it: open an `Issue` or update your GitHub Project card  
- 🤝 If team-based: open a **PR**, request review, and resolve feedback

---

#### ✍️ Example Git Commit Messages

- ✅ `feat: added user login flow`  
- 🐛 `fix: resolved mobile header bug on iOS`  
- 🧹 `refactor: cleaned up CSS naming conventions`  
- 📄 `docs: added setup instructions to README`

> 🔁 Tip: Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style — it helps everyone (and your future self).

## ✏️ Practice Prompt (Tutor Mode)

```prompt
Act as a GitHub onboarding coach.  
Help the user understand how to fork, clone, make a commit, push to a branch,  
and open a pull request.  
Explain each step with clear commands, reasoning, and links to where that  
action shows up visually in the GitHub interface.  
Include 1 cultural insight about open source contribution.

🔥 Bonus — Why GitHub Is Dope
🔍 Transparency = Instant trust

🌐 Collaboration = Global reach

🏗️ Modularity = Infinite remixing

📈 Contributions = Career capital

🧰 Infinite free tools, themes, starter kits, codebases

🎓 Learn by doing, reviewing, and contributing to real-world projects

🪐 GitHub = Where Modern Builders Live
If you’re not on GitHub, you’re building in a vacuum.
If you are — use it like a living system, not a backup folder.
