# 🏫 Schoolhouse Vault

**A modular vault for AI prompt engineering, builder rituals, and cognitive clarity.**  
This is where I test, train, and refine tools that help people build, think, and operate like systems architects.

> “This isn’t a note vault. It’s a forge.”

## 🔧 What's Inside

- `schoolhouse-onboarding.md` — Start here. Core setup + prompt writing intro.
- `schoolhouse-manifest.md` — Full file index of modules and rituals.
- `modules/` — Guided learning packs on prompts, systems, and UX.
- `templates/` — Reusable prompt frameworks, log formats, and GPT stacks.
- `rituals/` — Tools for clarity resets, friction logging, and behavior change.
- `outputs/` — Your work goes here. Save it. Iterate on it. Archive what works.

## 🧠 Philosophy

The Schoolhouse Vault is part of an ongoing method — a way to learn AI literacy, build mental tooling, and train prompt fluency *by doing, not organizing*.

This vault is not a knowledge graveyard.  
It’s a builder’s space for testing, naming, saving, and refining **what works.**

## ✅ First Step

1. Open `schoolhouse-onboarding.md`
2. Follow the Quick Start setup
3. Create your first file inside `outputs/`  
   > Prompt. Reflect. Repeat.

## 🛠️ Use It Freely

Fork the vault. Remix it. Clone only what’s useful.

This is free to use, but not empty.  
I teach workshops using this system — if you want to go deeper, reach out.
