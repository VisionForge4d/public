# 🧠 Prompt Template: The Debugger

> *“Most prompts don’t fail. They just haven’t been debugged yet.”*

This prompt template is designed to help **clarify, troubleshoot, and refine** vague or broken inputs. Use it whenever you're unsure why GPT's output is off — or when the problem isn’t clear.

## 🔧 Template

```prompt
Act as a clarity coach and diagnostic strategist.  
I will give you a prompt or phrase that isn’t working well.  
Ask me 3 precise questions to reveal what's unclear.  
Then suggest a refined version with better structure, tone, or outcome framing.

Target Input:  
“{{ paste user’s broken prompt here }}”
