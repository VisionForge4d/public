# 🌙 NightForge Protocol — End-of-Day Alignment + Learning Prep

> *“Sharpen tools by moonlight. Enter tomorrow forged.”*
**Time:** 9:45–10:00 PM (right before wind-down)
## 🎯 Purpose
The NightForge is your evening sync ritual — designed to:
- Recenter your intent
- Lock down your next day’s structure
- Integrate learning tasks tied to long-term vectors
- Ensure rituals > randomness

It functions as a reset loop and a launchpad — every night, 7–10 PM.

## 🔁 Weekly Learning Sync (Sundays)
- Review timeline-threads.md and `year-map-[current].md`
- Adjust active learning path
- Pre-load next module if Q2 or Q3 objective is tactical (ex: product release, launch)
- Shift `NightForge` output to teaching triggers if mastery flags have repeated 3+ times

---

## ⏱️ Tolerance Settings
- 🧠 Creative work → NO hard deadlines
- 📦 Deliverables → Deadlines OK (posted in scheduler-core)
- 🧪 Learning triggers → Auto-scheduled 1–2 weeks before related Q-task

---

## 🧲 Signals + Hooks
- Repeated prompts → flag for “teaching-ready” export
- Vault fragments → tagged for monetization if reused >3x
- Delayed learning modules → escalated via `learning-paths.md`

---

## ✅ Completion Checklist (Nightly)
- [ ] Schedule for tomorrow locked
- [ ] Friction noted (if any)
- [ ] Cue set for next priority
- [ ] Learning path primed or flagged
- [ ] Creative freedom protected (no overcommit)
