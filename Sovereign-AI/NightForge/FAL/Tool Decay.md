# 🧯 FAL Protocol: Tool Decay Reset
> *“You didn’t lose the tool. You lost the reason.”*

## 🧠 Trigger Conditions
- Tag `#tool_decay` logged **3+ times in 7-day window**
- Repeated avoidance, boredom, or disconnection from a previously trusted tool
- Survey quotes like:
  - “It feels hollow.”
  - “I keep skipping it.”
  - “I don’t know why I’m using this anymore.”

## 🩹 Micro-Routine: *“Reignite the Edge”*
Estimated time: 2–3 minutes

1. **Pause + Breathe (10 sec)**
   > Close the tab. Set down the app. Step away for one breath cycle.

2. **Recall the Why**
   > Ask: *“What timeline did this tool belong to?”*  
   > Reopen `the_map.md` or `purchase_log.md` and locate original vector

3. **Review One Win**
   > What moment *did* this tool serve you well? Name it aloud.

4. **Choose One:**
   - 🧭 *Recommit* → Anchor it to tomorrow’s schedule
   - 🛠 *Adapt* → Modify usage (frequency, depth, timing)
   - 🧺 *Shelf* → Log in `standby_shelf.md` with tag `#awaiting_clarity`

---

## 🧬 Follow-Up Action
- Add response outcome to `friction-log.md`
- If shelved, set review date (7–14 days out)
- If recommitted, link to current task thread in `the_map.md`
