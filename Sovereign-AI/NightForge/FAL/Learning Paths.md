# 🧠 Learning Paths — Skills, Rituals, and Systems to Master
> *“You don’t learn to build systems. You learn to become one.”*

## 🔁 CORE CYCLES (2025–2026)
These are the disciplines that reinforce everything else — the regenerative stack.

| Domain | Skill Focus | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Prompt Systems** | Template design, chaining logic, emotional tone | Core monetization + clarity stack |
| **Ritual Engineering** | Habit loops, symbolic triggers, identity cues | Sovereign behavior loop installation |
| **System Design** | Modular logic, file architecture, prompt IP schemas | Build tools that run without you |
| **AI UX** | Builder tools, custom GPT interfaces, embed rituals | Craft meaningful user flow + intuitive feedback |
| **Signal Reading** | Market sensing, pattern matching, GPT-triggered alerts | Spot where the opportunity is *before* others do |
| **Offer Crafting** | Product positioning, story-driven launch, micro-funnels | Translate clarity into cashflow |

## 🧱 SKILL TIER TAGS
Use these tags to mark progression and monetization readiness.
- `T1 - Awareness`: You know it exists
- `T2 - Usage`: You can use it in your workflow
- `T3 - Teach/Template`: You can build + teach it
- `T4 - License/Leverage`: You've monetized it or embedded it

## 🧭 LEARNING RITUALS
- `3x3 Reviews` → 3 Wins / 3 Lessons / 3 Sparks (weekly)
- `Echo Drops` → Log a phrase, dream, or insight worth building on
- `Forge Mode` → Integrate new skills into live tools immediately
- `Skill = System` → No learning without application into infrastructure
