## 🛠️ End-of-Day Friction Survey

### 1. ⚡ Where did energy stall or feel off today?
_(Frustration, hesitation, abandonment, delay, dread)_

> Example: “Didn’t want to open the writing file. Felt pointless.”

---

### 2. 🎯 What system/tool/practice didn’t perform as expected?
_(Rituals, prompts, tracking files, workflows, digital tools)_

> Example: “Used the productivity timer, but it felt hollow.”

---

### 3. 🧬 What internal friction showed up?
_(Doubt, boredom, resistance, identity mismatch, mood noise)_

> Example: “Felt like an impostor working on the launch again.”

---

### 4. 🧠 Did you reframe or override any resistance today?
_(If yes, what worked? If no, where did you bail?)_

> Example: “Talked myself back into it by reading old commit notes.”

---

### 5. 🧩 What patterns do you suspect are repeating?
_(Even small loops — e.g., every Tuesday feels heavy, always skip reset)_

> Example: “Every time I finish a big task, I lose momentum the next morning.”
