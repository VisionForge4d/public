| `#tool_decay` | 2 | Avoiding prompt packs that felt useful earlier |

### 🔧 Build Phase
| Tag | Count | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `#loop.flag` | 2 | Rebuilding same folders, dropping them again |

## 🧬 Insights + Recommendations

- `#identity_drift` during Launch → Run `launch_doubt_reset.v1.md`
- `#tool_decay` → Consider short-term shelf or micro-reframing (run `tool_decay_routine.v1.md`)
- `#loop.flag` in Build → Consider ritual simplification, flag potential obsession trap

Optional pushes:
- [ ] Adjust `the_map.md` with new ritual node
- [ ] Create `learning-paths.md` task if technical skill gap observed
- [ ] Highlight resilience streaks for ritual promotion (Map > Market)
