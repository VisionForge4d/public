# 🚀 FAL Protocol: Launch Doubt Reset
> *“This is the shadow that comes before the lift.”*

## 🧠 Trigger Conditions
- Tag `#launch_doubt` appears in surveys or logs
- Signs of product stall, narrative breakdown, or inner second-guessing
- Common flags:
  - “Is this even good enough?”
  - “Maybe I should wait.”
  - “I don’t know what I’m doing.”

## 🔥 Ritual: *“Re-enter the Fireline”*
Estimated time: 3–5 minutes

1. **Name the Flame**
   > Say aloud: *“I committed to this because…”*  
   > (Even if the answer feels small. Speak it.)

2. **Resurrect the Frame**
   > Open `the_map.md` or your vision arc
   > Find the **original problem** this launch is meant to solve

3. **Name One Person** it helps (real or imagined)
   > Picture their face. Say the tool is for *them*.

4. **Spot the Doubt Loop**
   > Ask: *“Is this the same voice that always shows up here?”*  
   > Name it. Disarm it. “Oh. You again.”

5. **Take One Tactical Step Forward**
   > Draft a file name. Write one tweet. Finalize the ZIP folder name. Any forward motion counts.

## 🧬 Follow-Up Action
- Add this entry to `friction-log.md` with tag `#launch_doubt`
- If helpful, cross-tag in `learning-paths.md` for future skill flagging
- Optional: Add a launch reaffirmation ritual to `night_forge/index.md`
