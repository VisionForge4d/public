# 🧱 Friction Snapshot — Signal Diagnostic

**Purpose:**
Capture resistance, confusion, or drift *in the moment* — and transmute it into signal. This ritual helps you log friction before it calcifies into avoidance.

---

## ⚠️ When to Use
- You’re procrastinating or spiraling
- You’re feeling off and don’t know why
- You’re hitting a wall mid-build

---

## 🧭 Snapshot Sequence

### 1. **What feels blocked or off right now?**
→ Describe the resistance without judgment

### 2. **Where is it showing up?**
→ (e.g. in the body, in your writing, in your decision-making)

### 3. **What is the imagined cost of doing the task?**
→ (e.g. failure, wasted effort, confusion, exposure)

### 4. **Is the friction real, emotional, or imagined?**
→ Name the type — you can even pick more than one

### 5. **What shift would reduce it by 1%?**
→ Micro-adjustment in posture, tone, focus, or scope
