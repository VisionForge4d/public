# 🪓 Friction Log
> *“Track the breaks. Don’t let the same crack split you twice.”*

This log is a rolling record of friction signals gathered from `survey.md`. It is used by the FAL system to detect repeated breakdowns, fatigue loops, and identity slippage.

- Flagged entries trigger protocol generation or ritual adjustment
- Positive resilience patterns can also be logged to reinforce them
