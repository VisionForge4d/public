# Sovereign

_Design your time. Guard your voice. Build as a system._

Sovereign is not a productivity framework.  
It is a modular architecture for self-governed builders, system thinkers, and ritual-driven creatives.

This is where you bring intention into time — not to squeeze more out of the day, but to align with who you are becoming.

## 🔧 What It Is

Sovereign is a living GitHub-based container for:

- **Blocks** — modular, reusable time units (rituals, loops, deep work stacks)
- **Timechain** — week-by-week flows of intention, action, and reflection
- **FAL** — the Friction Analysis Log, where behavioral drag and system breakdowns are diagnosed and documented
- **Rituals** — curated practices for syncing, resetting, launching, and restoring
- **Collab** — asynchronous spaces for contributors to speak in their own voice

Every file is versioned. Every action is sacred. This is infrastructure for builders who care.

## 🛡️ What Protects It

This project is bound by [The Covenant](./The_Covenant.md):

> A declaration that each contributor’s voice, insight, and authorship are honored.

No edits without consent. No reuse without attribution. No silent extractions.  
Only shared fire.

## 💬 Questions to Return To

- What are your sacred hours?
- What’s causing subtle drag in your week?
- Where does your current system fail to protect your time?

You don’t need to answer now.  
Sovereign is a mirror. Ask. Reflect. Adjust.
