# 🧭 Core Modules

## 🏛️ Sovereign (Calendar System)

- Master of time thread
    
- Click-to-print rituals
    
- Schedule proposals
    
- Timeline threading + friction-aware sync
    

## 🌑 NightForge (Log + Ritual Dock)

- Ritual logging + reset triggers
    
- FAL intake
    
- Drift tracking + response prompts
    

## 🧬 FAL (Fractal Analysis Layer)

- Silent pattern watcher
    
- Suggests proposals (via NightForge)
    
- Summary logs only on request
    
- Conflict + drift detection engine
    

## 🧱 ARC Lifecycle Protocol

- Arcs come from outside
    
- Must be templated as `arc.template.v1`
    
- Run through pre-check (conflict, density, drift risk)
    
- Accepted / adapted / declined by Sovereign
    
- Abort generates delta summary (scale + direction)
    

## 📦 Ritualware Print Layer

- Clean markdown-based ritual cards
    
- Minimalist design
    
- Signature: “– the Sovereign” in custom font
    
- Supports task print, ritual card, and proposal report
    

## 🌀 Architect-Arc (3-Month Overlay Quest)

- Thematic: Fuller → Rubin → Naval
    
- 3 Phases / 90 Days
    
- Runs inside NightForge
    
- Syncs with RootForce and Sovereign
    
- Outputs: builds, rituals, reflections

# 🎯 In Progress / To Build

-  ARC Conflict Checker
    
-  Friction Log Exporter
    
-  Sovereign/NightForge Chat UI
    
-  Arc Ingestion Flow

# 🔁 Operating Principles

- Arcs are overlays, not standalone systems
    
- FAL is silent until signal matters
    
- Rituals are lightweight but sacred
    
- Timeline is a stack, not a to-do list
    
- Adjustments are collaborative, not corrective

# 📍Next Navigation

-  Build UI mockups into visual canvas (Vite + React)
    
-  Load friction patterns into `.csv` → FAL checker
    
-  Finalize ritual taxonomies (types, interruptions, formats)
    
-  Sketch full-year arc system (ARC365)
