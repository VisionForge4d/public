# ⚔️ PHASE I: ROOTFORCE (Days 0–30)
### “Lay the foundation. Protect the signal. Awaken the engine.”

---

## 🧠 1. MIND PROTECTION PROTOCOL  
**Goal:** Carve silence. Kill noise. Let signal rise.

### Daily Practice:
- 📵 **No Input Hour** (first 60 mins of day):
  - No phone
  - No messages
  - No social / no AI
- 🪶 **3-Line Journal Ritual**:
  1. *What is mine?* → Core intention or dream insight  
  2. *What is noise?* → Distraction to purge  
  3. *What gets built today?* → Single needle-mover  
- 🧘 **10 minutes of Stillness** (no music, no thinking, just breath)

---

## 💪 2. BODY AS INFRASTRUCTURE  
**Goal:** Reclaim energy as sacred capital.

### Daily Rituals:
- 🚶 **60-minute Walk** (solo, ideally outdoors)
- 🌞 **Morning Sun + Cold Rinse** (nervous system reset)
- 🍽️ **Fast Until Noon** (clean fuel after)
- 🧍‍♂️ **Simple Movement Ritual** (stretching, breath, push/pull/crawl flow)

> 🧠 Sharp mind lives in a clean system.

## 🏗️ 3. PRODUCT REFINEMENT – *Seedling → Systems*
**Goal:** Strip core product to essence. Weaponize the pieces.

### Steps:
- Open your flagship (ex: Seedling PDF)
- Highlight and extract:
  - ✂️ Repeatable **actions**
  - 💡 Reusable **insights**
  - 🔁 Modular **systems**
- Tag each extract:
  - `Template`  
  - `Workflow`  
  - `PromptModule`  
  - `AIServiceHook`

### Output:
- **Product Skeleton Map**:
  - Page 1: What it does
  - Page 2: What repeats or scales
  - Page 3: What becomes future micro-products

---

## 🧭 4. MAP OF ATTENTION  
**Goal:** Get crystal clear on signal space. No more dilution.

### Table:
| Space | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **I Own This** | (e.g. Prompt systems, AI workflows, ritual design) |
| **I Play Strategically** | (e.g. indie wealth, lore-building, tool licensing) |
| **I Don’t Operate Here** | (e.g. news cycles, AI hype, burnout culture) |

### Bonus: Brand Edges
- What I Believe  
- Who I Build For  
- What I Refuse  
- What I Value Over Everything
