# MEMORY LOCK PROTOCOL

## Overview
A bidirectional behavior protocol designed to prevent timeline regression (e.g., buyer's remorse, tool drift) and condition cognitive resilience through anticipated friction zones. Based on real past signals and future self alignment.

## FORMAT: memory_lock.[name].v1

### Name: LAIRD_STASH_SIGNAL
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** Tool purchases, diet expansions, system pivots, identity reinforcement

## PHASE 1: 🚫 PREVENTATIVE GUARD

**Trigger:** Urge to acquire, commit, shift too quickly  
**Memory Cue:**
> “I thought I’d still be that version of me…”

**Action:**
- Ask: *Have I walked this path before?*
- If YES → run: `standby_signal.001`
- Log in: `standby_shelf.md` with tag `awaiting_timeline_clarity`

---

## PHASE 2: ⚡ FORWARD FRICTION PRIMING

**Trigger:** Known likely  future tension point — decision doubt, tool decay, energy collapse

**Projected Friction:**
> “This is where I usually question everything.”

**Conditioning Anchor:**
> “I knew this would happen. That’s why I made the decision while I was clear.”

**Action:**
- Reopen original commitment (`ritual_commit.md`, `purchase_log.md`)
- Run short ritual: breathe, review cue, reaffirm trajectory
- Say aloud: *“I’m meeting friction I already accounted for. Keep going.”*
